Features
Logging and Analytics
Implement logging functionality to record proxy activity and blocked requests. You can log information such as the timestamp, client IP address, requested URL, and response status. Additionally, consider integrating analytics tools to gain insights into user behavior and blocked requests.

Whitelist Support
Allow the administrator to define a whitelist of websites that should always be accessible, even if they are part of the blocklist. This feature can be useful for ensuring access to essential websites or work-related resources.

Authentication and User Management
Implement authentication mechanisms to allow multiple users to have their own blocklists and settings. This way, each user can configure their personalized blocklist and manage their own browsing restrictions.

Notification System
Develop a notification system that alerts users when they are nearing their time limit or when they attempt to access a blocked website. This can be implemented via email notifications, desktop notifications, or even SMS messages.

Mobile App Support
Extend the proxy functionality to include mobile devices by developing companion mobile apps for iOS and Android. These apps can provide additional features, such as real-time monitoring, blocklist management, and usage statistics.

Scheduling and Time Management
Enhance the "office hours" feature by allowing users to set personalized schedules for blocking websites. Users can define specific time intervals during which certain websites are blocked, aligning with their productivity routines.

Browser Extensions
Develop browser extensions for popular web browsers like Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. These extensions can simplify the setup process by allowing users to enable or disable the proxy, manage blocklists, and configure settings directly from their browser.

Performance Optimization
Optimize the proxy server's performance by implementing techniques such as caching mechanisms, connection pooling, and load balancing. These optimizations can help improve response times and handle high traffic loads efficiently.
